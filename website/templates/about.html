                Hi, my name is Rishabh. <br />
                I'm currently a senior at UMass Amherst, majoring in Computer Engineering with a Minor in Economics.  <br /> <br />
                My interests lie in game engine architecture as well artificial neural networks, although lately I've been working with recurrent neural networks. <br />
                I worked in the BINDS Laboratory, working with LSTMs and echo state networks to train recurrent nets and their reservoir computing variants to re-create pitch accurate renditions of Bach cantatas.<br /> <br />
                Strong analytical and math skills, with a proven <span class="github-link"><a href="/skills"><u>repository</u></a></span> in objected-oriented design. <br />
                I'm fascinated by large-scale applications, and the scalability of their architecture. <br /> <br />
                I'm a Tolkien buff, and you will probably find me re-reading his works, among others.
